# Introduction

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public websites. 
For example: 
- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
- this site!
